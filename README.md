# CoinTracker

## Requirements
Before proceeding with the installation, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Newtonsoft.Json
- Microsoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform
- Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- CommunityToolkit.Mvvm

## Usage
The application currently supports the display of cryptocurrency lists and their details during navigation. It also provides sorting and searching capabilities for cryptocurrencies. Localization is available in English and Ukrainian, but it is only activated when the OS language is changed.

## Future Development
- Improve the themes, not just changing the page background, as well as the interface.
- Fix a bug with themes; the `CurrentTheme` is constantly in the Default state and is overwritten every time.
- Fix the Charts deleted in the develop branch.
- Improve the bootloader with boot animation.
- Implement error catchers and an internet checker for enhanced functionality.
